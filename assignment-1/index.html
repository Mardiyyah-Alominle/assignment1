    <h1>ABOUT MYSELF</h1>
    <p>
      My name is Qosim Mardiyyah Alominle. My Alt school ID is ALT/SOE/023/2905.
      I am a student of Department of Electrical Electronics Engineering in the
      University of Ilorin. I was born on the 13th of June, 2005. I am from
      Kwara State, Nigeria but hailed from Lagos State, Nigeria . My hobbies
      include reading, watchin shorts, listening to Qur'an, coding and watching
      scenery. My best colour is blue. My dislikes are lying, disturbance,
      playing musics aloud, staying around crowd, cheating.

    <h2 id="biography">JOURNEY SO FAR IN PROGRAMMING</h2>
    <p>
      My journey started in the year 2020, before resuming to the University. I
      had issues with getting a laptop at first, after getting the laptop things
      were going smoothly then suddenly my laptop stopped working and i had to
      go back to my secondary school to complete my NECO Exams that were
      affected due to ENDSARS issues and ended the first face of the journey
      because the instructor was only available to take us for three month and I
      didn't get to finish HTML sef.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next University began 1st year was terrible and I knew I could not do the
      two together because even without programming my 1st semester results were
      not up to my expectation. Then ASUU strike began I continued learning my
      Fashion design, half way through the strike our neighbours husband came up
      to me that his wife was willing to tutor females interested in programming
      and i should for other people to join me I already got a laptop when
      earlier that year so no issues with that. Class started, no problem was
      able to balance it with my fashion design class. I was able to finsh HTML,
      CSS and Bootstrap and on getting started with javascript my laptop decided
      it was time for it to pack up the funny thing was the fact that the 3 of
      us taking the class laptops were not functioning. She started using her
      own pc to tach us but it was no fun and we couldnot move at the pace we
      needed to move and ASUU called of the strike and we had to resume back to
      school. JavaScrpt not finished.
    </p>
    <p>
      On resuming to school there is this friend of mine who is already a
      fullstack dev, because I didn't ignore programming this time around and I
      was having serious issues with JS then I told him and he gave me a full
      course on JS, but i was not able to finish it when school got really
      hectic and I knew my piorities and my goal was 1st class. I stopped but I
      always had it at the back of my mind that I have something pending to do.
      and that brings me to the reason why I joined ALT SCHOOL.
    </p>
    <h2 id="motivation">REASON WHY I JOINED ALT SCHOOL</h2>
    <p>
      I joined Altschool because I realised that I was not really desciplined
      and i needed a way to learn programming that would be in a school settings
      and I know that when assignment are given it has to be submitted before
      due date and my sister was also interested it computer was not sure what
      track. That was when I got to know about Alt school from my friend who
      told me it was the best option, then i did my research and told my dad
      about it and we registered, while she registered for Product design, I
      registered for Frontend Engineering.
    </p>
    <h2>GOAL AT THE END OF THE DAY</h2>
    <p>
      My goal at the end of the day at Altschool is just like every other
      students like me to become a Frontend Engineering with enough skill and
      attitude to strive in the job market and to also incorporate my Frontend
      career and my Electrical Electronics Engineering.

      And I pray almighty Allah make it easy for every single one of us to be
      able to scale through this journey and make good things out of it.
